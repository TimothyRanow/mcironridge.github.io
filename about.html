					About Us
					</h1>
						<br>
					<p>
						IronRidge is a Minecraft Server for adults. We launched IronRidge on March 16th, 2017 with a mission to offer the best vanilla Minecraft experience on the internet - while taking advantage of the great benefits of Spigot. Since launch we have accepted over 15 whitelist applications per week, despite recieving nearly twice that amount, and we have only been forced to issue one ban. 			
					</p>
						<br>	
					<h1>
					The World
					</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
						The seed for our survival world was heavily vetted before launch. We tested just over 50 seeds and twelve custom generation settings before agreeing on this world. IronRidge features beautiful rolling hills, giant cliffs, large open plains, complex river systems, and all three temperature clusters. For those who are interested, we have the Ice Spikes biome and a massive Mesa biome.
						<br><br>
						In addition to the fantastic seed, we also have great builders in our community. There is a wonderful village at the server's spawn point and multiple player-owned city projects that are in the works. We started a transportation initiative on March 31st to create an visually appealing way to navigate the map - making transport to and from your city or compound a fun and easy experience.
					</p>
						<br>	
					<h1>
					Survival
					</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
						IronRidge was created with Survival in mind. We play on Hard mode with minimal adjustments to survival mechanics. You are not given access to any teleport commands, or kits, or anything else that protects you from the wrath of the environment. PVP, explosion block destruction, fire spread, and enderman griefing are disabled to protect your builds from indirect player-griefing.
