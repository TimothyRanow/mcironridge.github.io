					<h1>About Us</h1>
						<br><br>
					<p>
						IronRidge was launched on March 16th with the goal of one day becoming the best SMP experience on the internet.
					</p>
					<h2>Our World</h2>
						<br>
					<p>
						We loaded over fifty seeds and tested ten different custom generation settings before settling on the current world. 
						As a result, our survival world features beautiful rolling hills, giant cliffs, large open plains, complex river systems, and all three temperature clusters. 
						There's a nice town at the spawn if you want to take a look around, or you can venture out and get to work right away. 
						We don't complicate the process with unnecessary tutorials.
					</p>
					<h2>Plugins</h2>
						<br>
					<p>
						We keep a minimal stack of plugins. 
						At the moment we are running function-only plugins. 
						Dynmap, WorldBorder, WorldEdit, Permissions, Essentials, and the like. 
						We plan to add more in the future, but they will not affect survival gameplay or give any players an unfair advantage.
					</p>
					<h2>The IronRidge Network</h2>
						<br>
					<p>
						Speaking of the future - we have a lot of great plans. 
						We are going to add several worlds to the IronRidge network - a creative superflat for testing builds, a standard creative world builders, resource worlds, and themed worlds for theme-exclusive building. 
						In addition to that, we have an excellent community vetting strategy and a range of resources available here on our website to stay in contact with fellow players - including a Discord server (just type /discord in game to get the invitation).
